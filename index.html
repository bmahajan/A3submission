			<h2>Reading &amp; Critique</h2>

			<p>
				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The visualization shows the progression of the number of COVID cases from 2020 to 2022. </li>
				<li>The spiral design helps draw the attention of users since it is eye-catching. Interestingly, as the black line moves away from the center and outward, the years progress, and the image itself is divided into 12 triangular sections indicating the 12 months of each year. </li>
				<li>The number of cases (7-day average) is perhaps depicted as the distance between the black line and the red line. So we see cases start out slow in March/April 2020 and quickly grow in number by January 2021. 
				</li>
				<li>The number of cases dies down a little until the end of July 2021 (presumably, the summer months have fewer people getting sick), but as soon as September/October 2021, we see a sharp rise in the 7-day average cases again. January 2022 sees another big burst of cases (presumably due to a new variant of COVID).
				</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			What it does very well:
			<ul>
				<li>It's eye-catching and effective at standing out to grab the reader’s attention. However, since it is slightly harder to digest, if the user is busy or mentally loaded, they may not spend the required time decoding all the information the visual presents. </li>
				<li>The color choice is also great, as red indicates something is wrong (more cases) compared to another color like green, which would have made the visualization less effective.</li>
			</ul>
			What could be better:
			<ul>
				<li>Due to the circular nature of the visual, it is very hard to compare the case numbers in different time periods, especially if the changes are not immediate – for example, it’s hard to tell the difference between the number of cases in Dec 2020 and Jan 2021. We can only grasp the general trends, but grounding the context is very difficult.
				</li>
				<li>Even small, simple improvements – like marking all months instead of just Jan, April, 
					July, and Oct – would make it easier for distracted and busy readers to digest the visual quickly.</li>
				<li>As the reader, I’m not sure why the image has two red lines mirrored across the black line; it has the potential to confuse readers. Is the total number of average cases at the time shown by the distance between the black line and the red line, or by the distance between the two red lines?
				</li>
				<li>Due to the relative nature of conveying magnitude in this visual, it is hard for readers to pinpoint, for example, what the number of cases was in a month like Sept 2021. They can tell the value is somewhere between 0 and 150K, but it is very hard to derive precise quantitative numbers.
				</li>
				<li>With the audience in mind, it is important to think about the scale of what this represents also. For example, if we show this to COVID mask deniers, the 150K does not look much different from the other months. Which can make them question the urgency of the situation</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					Average weekly cases of covid across the years 2020-2022 (Slow The Spread)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Tries to convey same data as original presentation but in a more humane way</li>
				<li>Human connection to COVID spread – Wanted to highlight the human aspect of transmission, so I used a man in the visual.
				</li>
				<li>Emphasizing contagion – Made the man coughing to signal how germs spread. Even if people don’t believe in COVID, most agree that germs are gross. This is meant to appeal to those who might ignore traditional data-driven visuals.
				</li>
				<li>Using red for impact – Chose red to grab attention and emphasize urgency</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Wanted to highlight real people and show the relative increase in cases at the end of each year - hence used human figures</li>
				<li>Adjusted the size of human figures to make the growth in new cases visually clear</li>
				<li>Mindful color choice – Avoided skin tones typically associated with specific races. Went with an deep orange-deep yellow mix for a more neutral yet effective visual</li>
				<li>Left out all quarters to prevent overcrowding in the diagram</li>
				<li>Deliberately did not use blue color to prevent viewers—especially in the U.S., where COVID was politicized—from making political assumptions about the data</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Each dot represents a stick figure to reinforce the idea that these numbers represent real people. Helps in Highlighting the human side of data</li>
				<li>Personally found the first two visuals more eye-catching, but some outlets might prefer a more subdued approach</li>
				<li>This design offers a straightforward alternative for audiences that may respond better to a more sober presentation</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>

			<h2>Design Process &amp; Design Decisions</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Keeps years in a linear display so readers can easily track changes over time</li>
				<li>Changes in color and size reflect the number of deaths each quarter, making trends easier to grasp at a glance</li>
				<li>Designed to be more eye-catching and intuitive compared to a typical linear graph</li>
				<li>As deaths increase, the color gets redder to reinforce the severity of the situation</li>
				<li>Larger elements signal the need for attention and make comparisons easier</li>

			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Compared to the original, this design offers a clearer sense of relativity over time. While the original visual divided data by months, this version’s quarterly approach simplifies the presentation while preserving the ability to compare trends. The linear format and proportional sizing of circles make it easier for viewers to quickly grasp that deaths have increased. Despite these changes, the design maintains key elements from the original: both visuals use red to convey urgency, both compare data over a two-year period, and both serve as a cautionary representation of rising numbers.
